<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The IOL Delivery Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preloaded IOL Delivery Systems</li><li>Non-Preloaded IOL Delivery Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The IOL Delivery Systems market is categorized into two main types: preloaded and non-preloaded systems. Preloaded IOL delivery systems feature intraocular lenses that are prepackaged and ready for insertion, enhancing surgical efficiency and reducing contamination risks. Non-preloaded IOL delivery systems, on the other hand, require the surgeon to manually load the lens into the delivery device, offering flexibility in lens selection but potentially increasing the complexity of the procedure. Both systems are vital for cataract surgeries and lens implantation procedures.</p></p>
