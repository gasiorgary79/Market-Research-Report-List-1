<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scuba Diving Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Respiratory System</li><li>Closed Respiratory System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The scuba diving equipment market features two primary types of respiratory systems: open and closed. An open respiratory system, commonly used in recreational diving, allows exhaled air to escape into the water, utilizing a simple regulator. In contrast, a closed respiratory system recirculates exhaled air after removing carbon dioxide, which is more efficient and enables longer dives. While open systems are popular for ease of use, closed systems are favored for deeper, extended dives due to their reduced gas consumption.</p></p>
